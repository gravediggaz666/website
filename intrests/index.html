<h2>How I started</h2>
    <p> I started getting an interest in graffiti when I was in sophomore year of high school.
I really liked walking home and always seeing different names and different styles portrayed in the
buildings. I didn't know anyone who has done graffiti, and i didnt know exactly what to expect.
I started off by think of a name, something unique but something I was already familiar with. I came
across this movie from my childhood called "Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory"(1971). There is
this scene in the movie where Wonka shows the kids fruit wallpaper, you are able to lick it and taste
like the fruit. Wonka later goes and says "Try some more, the strawberries taste like strawberries,
the SNAWZberries taste like SNAWZberries." This is how I got my name. SNAWZ </p>
    <h3>Practice</h3>
    <p>  I usually like using paint markers on old vinyls to write my name. I know how to use spray
paint. I want to learn how to do animal portraits. </p>
    <h3>Now</h3>
<p> Now, I don't really do alot of art, except in the weekends, I meet up with my friends and paint
permission walls to practice our spray paint techniques. In the future I hope to do a mural in my
community. This is a hobby I plan to keep and better myself.</p>
